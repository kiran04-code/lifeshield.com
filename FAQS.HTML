            <h2>Common Questions about vaccination?</h2>
            <article class="faq">
                <h4 class="faq-question">How do vaccines protect children from diseasecausing organisms?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">-Protection against diff erent infections is due to the
                    presence of some protective substances in the blood
                    (known as “antibodies”), which kills the disease-causing
                    organisms or neutralizes their eff ect when they enter the
                    body. Vaccines contain a weakened form, killed form or
                    part of the disease-causing agent (bacteria or virus), which
                    when introduced into the child’s body by a correct route and technique activates a protective response against
                    a targeted pathogen through generation of specifi c
                    antibodies. These protective substances or antibodies
                    further protect a child in case of a subsequent episode of
                    infection.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h4 class="faq-question">At what age should immunization start for any child?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">Under Universal Immunization Programme, immunization
                    of children starts as soon as child is born. Vaccination
                    against childhood tuberculosis (BCG), polio (OPV) and
                    maternally transmitted Hepatitis B (Hep B vaccine) are
                    given to a child immediately after birth. After this, specifi c
                    vaccines are given at recommended ages and routes as
                    outlined in National Immunization Schedule.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h4 class="faq-question">How much does the vaccination cost? </h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">Vaccines are costly and government spends a lot of money
                    in procuring them, and storing and transporting them at
                    correct temperature. However all immunization services
                    including vaccines, syringes, Mother and Child Protection
                    card and also medicines and supplements are given to all
                    children free of cost, at the government health facilities.
                     Similarly, immunization services to pregnant women
                    are also provided free of cost at the government health
                    facilities.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h4 class="faq-question">Where should the parents take their children for
                    vaccination? </h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">The parents/ caregivers can visit any government
                    health facility, including hospitals, medical colleges,
                    urban dispensaries, Primary Health Centres (PHCs),
                    Community Health Centres (CHCs), sub-centres and
                    Anganwadi centres to get their children vaccinated. In
                    villages and some urban areas (like slums and mohallas),
                    ANMs organize immunization sessions for providing
                    immunization services to children.
                     The government health department has ensured that
                    immunization services are provided at the facility nearest
                    to the benefi ciary. It is important to understand that
                    under National Immunization Schedule, vaccines are not
                    provided house to house, except in special campaigns and
                    drives like polio.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Which vaccines are better for children – those
                    provided by private practitioners or those provided
                    at the government health facilities? </h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"> All vaccines available in the country are licensed by Drug
                    Controller General of India (DCGI). Therefore, are safe
                    for use. Both government and private sectors procure
                    same vaccines from government-approved and licensed
                    manufacturers. However, complete immunization
                    services are given to all the children and pregnant women
                    free of cost, at government health facility.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-question"> Why do private providers offer some vaccines that
                    are not available in the Government‘s programme?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) implemented
                    by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare(MoHFW),
                    Government of India has a larger role of ensuring that
                    all children and pregnant mothers are protected from
                    diseases that infect, disable or kill a large number of
                    children and pregnant women. On the other hand, private
                    providers cater to individual children and parents who
                    approach to them for services on chargeable basis.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-question"> Since India is declared polio-free, why
                    vaccination against polio is given to children
                    in routine immunization as well as during pulse
                    polio campaigns?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Even though India has been declared polio-free, polio
                    infection is still present in some countries. There is a
                    constant risk of an infected person traveling into India
                    and spreading polio infection. Therefore, it is important to
                    vaccinate children and keep their protection high till polio
                    virus is fi nished from the world.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why is there pain and swelling at the injection
                    site? </h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">- In case of injectable vaccines (like Hepatitis B, pentavalent,
                    DPT and IPV), infants may have redness, mild pain, and
                    swelling at the injection site. This is absolutely normal and
                    goes within 1-3 days. This is not related to quality, safety
                    or effi cacy of the vaccines.</p>

            <article class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-question"> What is the reason for fever coming after
                    vaccination?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Occurrence of mild fever (specifi cally after Pentavalent
                    and DPT vaccines) is result of normal reaction that
                    vaccines have on body system. This fever is generally mild
                    in nature, self-limiting, and goes within 1-2 days.

                <h3 class="faq-question"> If a child is sick, can s/he be vaccinated?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"> A sick child suff ering from mild illness (like cough, cold,
                    or mild fever), mild diarrhoea or vomiting can be safely
                    vaccinated with injectable or oral vaccines. However, a
                    child who has some serious illness or is hospitalized (like
                    in high grade fever, severe diarrhoea, etc.), should not be
                    vaccinated until his or her condition improves. </p>

                    available at the health facility or session site?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">  In such situations, the health worker will give the child all
                    available vaccines for which s/he is eligible and will be called
                    for the remaining vaccination in the next immunization
                    session. However, the parents may also go to higher level
                    health facility for getting scheduled vaccines, or wait for
                    next immunization session day.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">We have heard that OPV leads to impotency, and
                    MR vaccine leads to autism. Is this true? </h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"> No. All vaccines used in Universal Immunization
                    Programme are tested and recommended for their quality
                    and effi cacy, and they are highly safe and eff ective. NO
