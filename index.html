    <div class="pg-1"><h2>Why vaccines are Important ?</h2>
        <p>Vaccines are not just important they are the very reason humanity has survived and thrived in the face of pandemics, plagues, and deadly 
            diseases for centuries. In a world where misinformation spreads at the speed of a tweet, and fear-mongering has replaced scientific fact, 
            refusing to vaccinate is not only a personal choice; it is a reckless act of negligence with profound consequences for public health. The 
            denial of science the refusal to accept the overwhelming, irrefutable 
            evidence that vaccines are safe and effective is not just dangerous; it’s criminal. If you still doubt the power of vaccines, it’s time to confront 
            the harsh reality: your skepticism doesn’t just harm you it harms everyone. Vaccines don’t just protect the individual who gets 
            vaccinated, they protect entire communities through a concept called herd immunity. So, let's be blunt: if you are still questioning the power 
            of vaccines, you are choosing ignorance over science, selfishness over responsibility, and risk over safety. And the next time you think about questioning the safety of vaccines, ask yourself: who are you really putting at risk? Because the truth is, your refusal could be the very thing that sparks the next outbreak

    <div class="pg-4"><h2>Myths and facts:</h2> <p>Vaccines are often surrounded by wild stories, but the truth is simple and reassuring. For example some people believe vaccines cause 
        autism. This fear started from one fake study that was proven wrong 
        years ago. Even though scientists have shown there’s no link, the myth still floats around. Then there’s the idea that falling sick naturally is 
        better than taking a vaccine. But why would you want to suffer through a dangerous disease when vaccines can protect you without the pain? 
        Vaccines are like a safety net for your health, ready to catch you before you fall. And the strangest myth of all? That vaccines contain 
        microchips to track people. That’s complete nonsense! Vaccines don’t have secret devices they’re just tools to protect lives and keep your immune system strong. What’s even more amazing is that vaccines 
        don’t just protect you. They protect your loved ones, your neighbors, and even strangers. It’s like creating a protective circle around 
        everyone. So, in a world full of myths, let’s stick to the facts: vaccines are safe, effective, and they save lives

    <div class="pg-5"><h2>Currents Affairs :</h2><p>India’s vaccination story in 2023 is a mix of challenges and hope. Over 1.6 million children missed important vaccines like DPT and measles, and another 2 million didn’t get a single vaccine—these kids are called 
        “zero-dose” children. Behind these numbers are families who want their children to grow up healthy but haven’t had the chance to get them 
        vaccinated. he good news is that efforts like Mission Indradhanush and its newer version, IMI 5.0, are changing the story. These programs have already helped vaccinate millions of children. It’s not just about giving 
        vaccines; it’s about giving every child a fair chance at life. Vaccination is 
        more than just a health drive—it’s about hope and a promise for a better future. By making vaccines available and spreading awareness, we can ensure every child, no matter where they are, gets the protection they 
        need. Together, we can build a healthier, happier India where no child is left behind.

   <div class="pg-8"><h2>Negligence of vaccines in INDIA:</h2><p>Vaccine negligence in India is a ticking time bomb, and its consequences are deadly. Despite the proven safety and 
    effectiveness of vaccines, rising misinformation and lack of 
    awareness are causing more people to refuse or delay immunization, 
    putting everyone at risk. When vaccination rates drop, diseases like polio and measles can return, putting vulnerable populations—
    children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised—at severe risk. 
    This isn’t just a personal choice; it’s a public health threat. Our communities, our children, our future—all are at stake. It's time to 
    stop ignoring the science, fight back against myths, and make sure 
    every person gets vaccinated. The cost of negligence is too high, and we cannot afford to lose the progress we’ve made. Vaccines save lives—don’t let fear and ignorance take them away.
